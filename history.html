    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <p>For much of history, the state that today we call Bangladesh was known only as Bengal; what happened elsewhere on the Indian subcontinent affected this region, too. Dominated at different periods of history by Buddists, Hindus, the Mughals and the East India Company, modern Bangladesh is a product of imperial Britain's Partition of India – a majority-Muslim nation initially joined to Pakistan, and finally born as an independent nation in 1971 after a bloody liberation war.</p>

        Bangladesh may only have existed as an independent state for 30 years but its cultural and linguistic roots go deep. The Bangla language (the term Bengali was just a British colonial rendering of this) was distinct by the 7th century and a literature written in it was emerging by the 11th century. Religion has also tended to set the Bangla-speaking people apart: for more than a millennium they bucked the Hindu trend by remaining Buddhist, while since the 12th century, when Muslims invaded from the northwest, Islam has won the loyalty of the majority.

            <h1>War Of independence</h1>
            <p>The links between the two wings of Pakistan were tenuous, however, and the East was threatened from the first by Pakistan leader Mohammed Ali Jinnah’s avid promotion of Urdu as the national language. Bangla discontent festered, particularly after the military took over in Pakistan in 1958. Resistance coalesced around Mujibur Rahman (known as Sheikh Mujib), who was jailed repeatedly by the military while campaigning for autonomy. In 1971 Mujib’s Awami League won 167 of 169 seats in East Pakistan. Amid crisis talks aimed at preventing independence, West Pakistan’s army launched a genocidal attack, killing thousands and arresting Mujib. Around 10 million refugees fled to India, where Awami League leaders declared independence on 26 March. Dogged guerrilla resistance began until finally, in December 1971, the Indian army invaded and ejected Pakistani forces. The war had cost three million lives. Mujib became leader of an independent Bangladesh.</p>
